# Chat-App
This application is chat for many users. Users must be connected to the Internet with
same router. Then program runs on one of the computers, enabling everyone
connected to the router talk with each other. To create this application I used
Spring MVC implementing REST (with Jackson library converting response to JSON files), 
jQuery library using AJAX methods.
